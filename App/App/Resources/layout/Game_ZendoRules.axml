Note that koans that have the buddha-nature are marked with a white circle in front of the koan, and koans that do not have the buddha-nature are marked with a black circle in front." />

I have redesigned it to be more free for all. If the master doesn't have a koan to analyze, anyone can submit one, at which point everyone else must wait for the master to analyze it. Mondos are also altered: so as to avoid a situation where one person is holding up everyone else, the master is notified to analyze a koan once at least HALF of the students have made predictions, rather than forcing the master to wait for everyone to have made a prediction." />
